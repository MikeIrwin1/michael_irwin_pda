### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

# line 20 has a syntax error 'dif' should be 'def' also line 22, card does not exist, should be return card1

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end

#there is an extra end on line 27 which closes the class so that the following method is outside of the class.
# line 33 should set the value of total, at the moment the variable is not defined.

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end
```
